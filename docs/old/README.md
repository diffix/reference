This folder contains out-of-date design docs. Here for handy reference (versus having to chase down some old branch).

## Low Count Filtering

* lcf.md is the original design doc for low count filtering (using the traditional "wide-spread" normal distribution approach).
* lcf2.md is the next design for low count filtering (using the "thin-spread" uniform distribution approach)
* lcfParams.py is a small program that generates statistics for various LCF settings
