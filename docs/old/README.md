# Docs

This folder contains out-of-date design docs. Here for handy reference (versus having to chase down some old branch).

* lcf.md is the original design doc for low count filtering (using the traditional "wide-spread" Normal distribution approach).
* lcfParams.py is a small program that generates statistics for various LCF settings
