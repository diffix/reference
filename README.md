# Prototype

A live version of this prototype can be found at [db-proto.probsteide.com](https://db-proto.probsteide.com).

## Development process

This is a relatively low ceremony prototype.
We develop on feature branches to limit the changes of merge conflicts, but feel
free to merge your own pull-requests if you wish. Liekwise if you are working on
some complex idea that you want someone to take a look at, feel free to assign
someone to review it.

This prototype is meant to be throwaway code. It's a playground to figure out which
ideas work, and which do not.
